#The purpose of creating issue

1. Tracking tasks and bugs: Issues provide a structured way to track tasks, bugs, and enhancements related to a GitHub project. This allows developers to 
easily prioritize work, assign tasks, and keep track of progress.

2. Centralizing communication: Issues serve as a central hub for communication around specific project tasks or issues. Developers can discuss potential solutions, 
share ideas, and provide updates without cluttering up other channels like email or chat.

3. Improving transparency: Issues promote transparency by making project progress and discussions visible to all contributors. This fosters collaboration and ensures 
that everyone is on the same page.

4. Documenting project history: Issues provide a valuable record of project history, capturing discussions, decisions, and resolutions related to specific 
tasks or bugs. This can be helpful for reference or when onboarding new contributors.

5. Facilitating prioritization: Issues allow for effective prioritization of tasks and bugs based on their severity, impact, and urgency. This helps developers 
focus on the most critical issues first.
