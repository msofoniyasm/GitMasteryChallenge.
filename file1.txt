#Why do we need branchs?

Branches are essential for software development because they allow developers to isolate changes and work on different 
versions of the code simultaneously without affecting the main codebase. This is particularly important for large projects
with multiple contributors, as it prevents conflicts and ensures that the main codebase remains stable and functional.
